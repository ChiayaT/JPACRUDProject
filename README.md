# JPACRUDProject


## Overview
- Create an Application that allows CRUD communications to a database's table. The communication occurs within the web interface which allows the user to look up Songs by it's id, then to delete or update that very song. When a song is looked up, the correct information of the song is displayed.

## Technologies used
- MYSQL
- SPQL
- SPRING MVC
- Eclipse
- SERVLET MAPPING
- BEANS
- POJOs
- MAMP
- TOMCAT
- DAO
- SPRING BOOT

## Lessons Learned
- How to map with spring boot, which took some time to figure out, but it was actually alot easire than the CRUD MVC project

- Images need to be specified and possibly downloaded when working with a local host since the interface may not have access to the web image

- Mapping with different syntax

- Learning how spring boot does most of the work for the user.
